        <h2 class= "card-title">About</h2>
        <p>I am half Japanese and half New Zealander. My three biggest passions in life are travel, art and helping others. These three things are what inspired me to finally decide to learn code. From a young age, I have always been creative. From learning guitar from the age of 5, to picking up a camera and indulging myself in photography and videography. </p>
        <p>I have also always had a interest in computers and how they worked. I was always the go to guy when it came to helping my parents with anything tech related (most of the time it was just turning it off and on). After doing a bit of research, I found that coding was one of the careers that can allow me to do what I love every day. My three passions: Travel, art and helping others.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>  Travel: Because we are living in a digital world, the possiblities of working remotely have never been so possible. As long as you have a internet connection, you can do your job.</li>
        <li>  Art: Coding is all about creativity! Anything you can imagine, can be made. Literally.</li>
        <li>  Helping others: With this new skillset, you have the ability to cure peoples headaches and help others make their imaginations come to life.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this a learn a little bit about who I am. If you would like to get to know me some more, follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/apihemi/" target="_blank">instagram.</a></p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 class= "card-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>Firstly, I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eventually, I’d like to work for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive and aesthetically pleasing online presence.</p>
        <p>Later down the line, I would also like to dive into IOS Development. Learning how to use languages such as</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Swift</li>
        </ul>
        <p> pushing my passion for creating, even futher. And, hopefully one day creating a simplistic yet fun and enjoyable app, that can help people in their day to day lives.
